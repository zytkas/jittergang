JitterGang is a customizable mouse jitter tool designed for gaming and other applications where controlled mouse movement is desired. It provides various jitter patterns and controller support.

## Features

- Multiple jitter patterns: Left-Right, Circle, and Pull-Down

- Controller support

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Windows 10 or higher 
- .NET Framework 8.0
- DirectX runtime

### Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/zytkas/jittergang/releases/tag/Release).

### Important Notes on Jitter Activation

- **Mouse**: The jitter effect is only active while the left mouse button is pressed.
- **Controller**: When using a controller, the jitter is only activated when the Right Trigger (RT) is pressed, not other buttons.
- **Controller Jitter**: When the controller is active, the strength parameter does not affect the jitter intensity.
